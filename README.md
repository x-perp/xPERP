Foundry-based Solidity smart contract.

## Deployed Contract

Mainnet:
[0x0D7e2Ba85fF3604D6ae5C56d1A5df334D9883725](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D7e2Ba85fF3604D6ae5C56d1A5df334D9883725)

Goerli testnet:
[0x966E9031c06C09445625ced68a653582fbB18a73](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x966E9031c06C09445625ced68a653582fbB18a73)

# Upgradable

The contract is a UUPS proxy implemented using an ERC1967Proxy.

By default, the upgrade functionality included in UUPSUpgradeable contains a security mechanism that will prevent any
upgrades to a non UUPS compliant implementation. This prevents upgrades to an implementation contract that wouldnâ€™t
contain the necessary upgrade mechanism, as it would lock the upgradeability of the proxy forever. This security
mechanism can be bypassed by either of:

- Adding a flag mechanism in the implementation that will disable the upgrade function when triggered.
- Upgrading to an implementation that features an upgrade mechanism without the additional security check, and then
  upgrading again to another implementation without the upgrade mechanism.

The current implementation of this security mechanism uses EIP1822 to detect the storage slot used by the
implementation.

# Deploying

```sh
# this runs the deploy script on a local network, to run for real you'll need to broadcast.
# See forge scripting for more info.
forge script DeployUUPS
```

## Deployment procedure

1. Deploy the xperp token contract setting the team wallet.
2. Configure revsharebot address.
3. Run `init()` to initialize epochs and the LP.
4. Sending the dedicated owner 1M tokens which is a fixed totalsupply (before 5**!**).
5. Ownership transfer to the launcher.
6. The launcher puts xperp along with ETH to the liquidity pair.
6. Executing`EnableTradingOnUniswap` function.

## Addresses

- revsharebot: 0x87d71b3756A1e9c3117eEc8a79380926f66b80C3
- owner: 0x11eD88f6eE21F5808EB4B37D8292c57dc3Cc5e19
- team: 0x1746CF93F3368B4326423a82734A0ECC65D57bC5

## Liquidity Pair xperp/WETH

## What's Inside

- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/forge): compile, test, fuzz, format, and deploy smart
  contracts
- [Forge Std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std): collection of helpful contracts and cheatcodes for testing
- [PRBTest](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-test): modern collection of testing assertions and logging utilities
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): code formatter for non-Solidity files
- [Solhint Community](https://github.com/solhint-community/solhint-community): linter for Solidity code

## Usage

```sh
$ pnpm install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
$ forge test --fork-url  YOUR_MAINNET_NODE_URL -vvvv --gas-report
```

All tests should pass, and you should see a gas report at the end.
Test are executed against a mainnet fork to keep a real uniswap pair mirror, and to test the revenue sharing feature.
